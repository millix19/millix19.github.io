Hi! I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, advised by <a href="https://www.phontron.com/">Professor Graham Neubig</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/">Professor Chenyan Xiong</a>. 

My interests are broadly in large-scale machine learning and natual language processing.

**I am currently applying for Fall 2026 PhD programs, please contact me emilyx@cs.cmu.edu if you're interested in collaborating!**
